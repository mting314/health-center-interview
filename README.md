# health-center-interview

For a recent job application to [UCLA's Center for Health Policy Research](https://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/Pages/home.aspx), I was asked to do some data processing tasks in R, specifically using [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html).

You can see the questions and the answers I wrote in those ipynb notebooks (yes, there's a way to get R working in a Jupyter Notebook environment! Really happy about that). These are interview questions so as they stand alone, they don't really have any practical use, but I'll put these here just to prove I know some R :)
